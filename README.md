# FtoCCalculator
CSC-171 Assignment 1
For assignment 1, do Program Project #1 on page 131 of our text.  This program will prompt the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit as a whole number.  The program will use
the formula give to convert the temperature into degrees Celsius as a floating-point number, rounded to 1 decimal place.  The program will then display the converted temperature
on the screen, correctly labelled.  Assume that the user correctly enters an integer.  Name the package, package1, and the class,  FMCLProg1.  FMCL = your first, middle,
confirmation (if any) and last initials.

As a comment after the code, write the steps you need to do to solve the problem (that is the algorithm as pseudocode.)
